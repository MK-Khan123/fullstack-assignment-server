# Grocery House (Full Stack Assignment)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Firebase Live Site Link

The project was deployed at Firebase and you can access the link by clicking here [Firebase Live Site Link](https://fullstack-assignment.web.app/).

### `Project Features`

In this project, we were introduced to the idea of backend technologies. We had hands on experience of using MongoDB, Express.js (a framework for Node.js).

1. User can buy grocery items from the homepage but he/she needs to login first. Applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access. Implemented Google and Facebook sign in method using Firebase Authentication.

2. On the process of buying, a checkout page is loaded by using route parameter to fetch data dynamically from MongoDB and displayed data accordingly. Userâ€™s order specific details are stored on MongoDB.

3. We used create, read, and delete of CRUD operations in this project. Unlike using fakeData, this time data displayed in our homepage is fetched from MongoDB. We slightly used React Authentication along with our previous knowledge of React Routing.

4. Admin can add/remove products and when products are added/removed, changes are reflected immediately on the homepage. User can view his/her specific order summary by clicking on 'Orders' tab.

5. In addition, we used plain bootstrap to make the website device responsive. Furthermore, we deployed our site on Firebase which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to experience the website.
